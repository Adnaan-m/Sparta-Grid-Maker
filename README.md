# Gridder
### Description
The following document shows an understanding of the use of javascript to implement back end structures. The current tasks involve the creation of a grid using javascript followed by interactive methods of squares highlighting when they are clicked.

### Languages used
* Javascript

### How to download
1. Search for Adnaan-m in GitHub.
2. Search for the Sparta-Grid-Maker repository.
3. Download the files displayed.

### Challenges 
1. Starting the task was very difficult. Once I had the skeleton and the plan laid out, the scope became clearer.
2. Another challenge I came across was the implementation of a variety of highlighted colors when clicking on each square. I managed to change the colour once to a specific colour but could not implement the change in color after every click.
3. Finally, I also struggled with the correct implementation of functions/methods in order to make the code run better.

### Learning points
1. The use of javascript to create tags, classes and links etc.
2. The use of javascript to provide back end functions.
